# 42 Piscine 

"In the initial week, candidates receive instruction on foundational Shell commands, permission management, basic terminal navigation, folder and file manipulation, SSH usage, and an introductory overview of Git repositories, accompanied by scripting fundamentals. The subsequent phase delves deeper into scripting, progressively advancing towards C language modules. Starting from fundamental concepts, candidates learn about character printing, numerical operations, basic functions within standard libraries, and gradually explore memory management. This progression is tailored to assess the candidate's pre-existing programming proficiency level effectively. Moreover, weekends feature 'rush' projects—group assignments of notably higher complexity than standard tasks—designed to challenge and enhance collaborative problem-solving skills. Additionally, Fridays include evaluation exams to gauge individual progress and understanding."

# Extras 
Thanks to all the people involved in this experience, whether they became students or not. Truly an experience that changes lives, the level of programming acquired, the friends made, the staff making our lives impossible (just kidding, we love you), the talks until 4am, the nights on 42 solving projects, and the entire community of which we feel part and that in my case I have had the opportunity to know as a student that today has opened doors for me that I would not have imagined having known.
